# Calendars
 Motor Racing and Sports Calendars

This project uses BeautifulSoup webscraping to pull in schedule information from various leagues/series/teams 
The schedule data is cleaned and reformated to allow compatability with the iCalendar python library to generate RFC 5545 compliant .ics calendar files.

Not all project files are complete at this time. Completed notebooks can be run to output a .ics file for that series to your local storage.

Each series/league/team website requires a different scraping approach. Existing notebooks can be used as a templete and adapted to other calendar sources.
